This project presents an analysis of any Spotify artist chosen by the user, analyzing their 10 most popular tracks. It focuses on quantifying the danceability, energy, and acoustic level of each song. My aim is to provide Spotify users a tool for exploring an artist's top hits and uncovering new favorites â€” without needing to listen to each track.
